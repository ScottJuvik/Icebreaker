## Introduction
Many young individuals find it challenging to establish new acquaintances, especially in new environments where they know few or no one else participating in the event. Our target audience expresses that they often step out of their comfort zones to attend events in hopes of meeting like-minded people. To ease the atmosphere and facilitate conversations, customers express that it would be beneficial to have a collection of ice-breaker activities readily available. Therefore, I aim to create a service where users can find suggestions for such ice-breaker activities.

## Project Description
This project aims to provide a platform offering a comprehensive list of ice-breaker activities where users can search for or submit specific activities and add them to a queue that can be shared with other users. It should be possible to differentiate between different types of ice-breaker activities based on the circumstances they are suitable for. Each ice-breaker activity will have its own page with a description, rules, as well as ratings and reviews provided by other users. Additionally, there will be a list of popular ice-breaker activities for users who are unsure of what they are looking for. The goal of the service is to make it easier for individuals to initiate conversations and get to know new people.
