# Spring Boot Backend

### Getting Started

Ensure you have java and maven installed before you proceed.

**IceBreaker_Backend** you need to move into the icebreaker_backend folder. Do this with the following command:


```
cd icebreaker_backend

mvn install -DskipTests
mvn compile

mvn spring-boot:run
```

Now the server is running, you can now open a new terminal and follow the instructions in the frontend [README](/IceBreaker/icebreaker_frontend/README.md).
